# Parser of games

A library and set of tools to parse 3DS game formats.

## Tools:

List pokedex text entries:

```
cargo run --bin pokedex -- game.3ds
cargo run --bin pokedex -- --alt game.3ds
```

## Format documentation

There's a docs.txt file with a very minimal description of the formats that I
run into. I'm keeping it restricted to things that I can't find documented
anywhere else for now.
